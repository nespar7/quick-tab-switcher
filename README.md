## Introduction
Chrome's tab switching is stupid, I want to go to the last tab I opened, not swim through a sea of tabs.

## Instructions
1. Clone this project on your local machine
2. Open the chrome extensions page(chrome://extensions)
3. Turn on developer mode at the top right corner of the page
4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button at the top left corner
5. Select the location of this project

## Commands
* `Alt + Q`: Takes you to the most recently used tabs
* `Alt + W`: Opens a popup with tabs listen in MRU order
* `Click the extension icon`: Opens the same popup as above

## Issues
Keyboard commands work only on brave because chrome refuses to register Alt+Q or Alt+W
