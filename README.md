## Introduction
Chrome's tab switching is stupid, I want to go to the last tab I opened, not swim through a sea of tabs.

## Commands
`Alt + Q`: Takes you to the most recently used tabs
`Alt + W`: Opens a popup with tabs listen in MRU order
`Click the extension icon`: Opens the same popup as above

## Issues
Keyboard commands work only on brave because chrome refuses to register Alt+Q or Alt+W
